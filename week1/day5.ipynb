It just took us a couple of hours to adapt our code, and have a functioning and totally custom endpoint.\\nAndrea Boscarino\\nData Scientist at Musixmatch\\nEndpoints for\\nHealth\\nPhamily improves patient health with intelligent care management\\nUse Case\\nHIPAA-compliant secure endpoints for text classification\\nModels Deployed\\nCustom model based on text-classification (MPNET)\\nCustom model based on text-classification (BERT)\\nIt took off a week's worth of developer time. Thanks to Inference Endpoints, we now basically spend all of our time on R&D, not fiddling with AWS. If you haven't already built a robust, performant, fault tolerant system for inference, then it's pretty much a no brainer.\\nBryce Harlan\\nSenior Software Engineer at Phamily\\nEndpoints for\\nSearch\\nPinecone is the vector database for intelligent search\\nUse Case\\nAutoscaling endpoints for fast embeddings generation\\nModels Deployed\\nDifferent sentence transformers and embedding models\\nWe were able to choose an off the shelf model that's very common for our customers to get started with and set it so that it can be configured to handle over 100 requests per second just with a few button clicks. With the release of the Hugging Face Inference Endpoints, we believe there's a new standard for how easy it can be to go build your first vector embedding based solution, whether it be semantic search or question answering system.\\nGareth Jones\\nSenior Product Manager at Pinecone\\nEndpoints for\\nVideos\\nWaymark is a AI-powered video creator\\nUse Case\\nMulti-modal endpoints for embeddings,
